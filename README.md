## Polynomial Regression
<ul><li>Polynomial Regression is a regression algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent(y) and independent variable(x) as nth degree polynomial.  </li>                     
 <li>The Polynomial Regression equation is given below:   </li>                            
y= b0+b1x1+ b2x12+ b2x13+...... bnx1n                                                         
<li>It is also called the special case of Multiple Linear Regression in ML. Because we add some polynomial terms to the Multiple Linear regression equation to convert it into Polynomial Regression.</li>
<li>It is a linear model with some modification in order to increase the accuracy.</li>
<li>The dataset used in Polynomial regression for training is of non-linear nature.</li>
<li>It makes use of a linear regression model to fit the complicated and non-linear functions and datasets.         </li>      </ul>
Hence, "In Polynomial regression, the original features are converted into Polynomial features of required degree (2,3,..,n) and then modeled using a linear model."
